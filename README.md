## Author: Shalini P
## Batch: (1 November- 30 November,2023)
## Domain: 
JAVA Programming
## Aim: 
To build a Student Management System
## Description/Working of code:
1. In the Student class, attributes like name, roll number, grade, etc., are declared as instance variables. Constructors are defined to initialize these attributes when a new Student object is created.

2. The StudentManagementSystem class manages the collection of students. Methods to add, remove, search, and display students are implemented.

3. The user interface is designed using a console-based interface. Options like adding a new student, removing an existing student, searching for a student, displaying all students, and exiting the application are provided.

4. Methods to read and write student data are implemented in the StudentManagementSystem class. These methods interact with the storage medium to save and retrieve student data.

5. The program follows the following logic:
   
* Read the existing student data from the storage medium.

* Display the options to the user.

* Read the user's choice and perform the corresponding operation.

* Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the user chooses to exit the application.

* Write the updated student data back to the storage medium.

7. Input validation is implemented in the methods where the user inputs data. The code checks that the required fields are not left empty and that the data is in the correct format.
